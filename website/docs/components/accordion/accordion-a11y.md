@## Accessibility recommendations

- The user should be able to open/close the accordion section using the keyboard.
- All focusable elements in the accordion must be included in the page `Tab` sequence.

| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Space` or `Enter` | When focus is on the accordion header of a collapsed section, expands the section. |
| `Tab`              | Moves focus to the next focusable element.                                         |
