@## Core libraries

If you're building an interface inside the Semrush suite, feel free to use our Figma libraries with core components, icons, and charts:

> **You can just duplicate our libraries from Figma Community and start exploring**. There are a lot of helpful tips and hints right inside the libraries.

> Therefore, if you have a new illustration, pattern or email template, feel free to add them to the shared libraries. This will make it easier for your colleagues to find ready-to-use illustrations, icons and email templates in the future.
