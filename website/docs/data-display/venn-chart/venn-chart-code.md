@## An example of a simple use

In the data, we specify `size`, which is the size of the circle, and `sets`, which is the intersection of the circles.

@example basic

@## Setting the orientation

The chart orientation (rotation) and the order of circles can be changed.

@example orientation-and-order

@## Legend

You can add and remove the legend yourself (we'll add this example later ðŸ¤·).

@## Data loading

@example skeleton
