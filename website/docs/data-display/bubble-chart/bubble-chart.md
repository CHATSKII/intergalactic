@## Description

A **bubble chart** visualizes relationships between data categories using proportions, colors, and positioning on a coordinate axis. This chart type helps you analyze patterns between datasets.

It allows to visualize up to 3-4 parameters for datasets. A bubble chart is a mix between a scatterplot chart and a proportional area chart.

As the documentation for Microsoft Office explains, "You can use a bubble chart instead of a scatterplot chart if your data has three data series that each contain a set of values. The sizes of the bubbles are determined by the values in the third data series.".
