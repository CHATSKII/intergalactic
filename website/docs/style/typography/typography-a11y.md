@## Accessibility considerations

- Avoid small font sizes.
- Do not style text to give the visual appearance of headings - use actual heading tags.
- Web page should allow typography to be magnified up to 200% by the user without clipping or distorting content.
- Limit the use of font variations such as bold, italics, and ALL CAPITAL LETTERS (capital letters look provocative in screen readers).
- Use real text rather than text within graphics.
